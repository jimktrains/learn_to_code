I came across the book 'Elementary Pascal," in which the authors use Sherlock Holmes stories to teach children Pascal by writing Pascal programs to solve mysteries.

I felt that a modern-day equivalent would be nice, so this is my attempt to write a book where the child works through various programs and problems to learn the concepts of programming via the Python language.

Right now, this is a work in progress.  Critiques, pull-requests, and ideas would be greatly welcomed.
