I came across the book 'Elementary Pascal," (http://books.google.com/books/about/Elementary_PASCAL_as_chronicled_by_John.html?id=SLkxH9QRvCwC) (http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Learning-Program-Computer-Sherlock/dp/B002T6VZJI) in which the authors use Sherlock Holmes stories to teach children Pascal by writing Pascal programs to solve mysteries.

I felt that a modern-day equivalent would be nice, so this is my attempt to write a book where the child works through various programs and problems to learn the concepts of programming via Python 3.

Ideally each chapter would be a puzzle, riddle, or mystery to solve and build upon what has been written in the chapters before it.

Right now, this is a work in progress.  Critiques, pull-requests, and ideas would be greatly welcomed.
