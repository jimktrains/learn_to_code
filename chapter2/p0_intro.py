# grades, wants your help to figure out who stole the red stapler from the
# class room.  Here are the clues that the teacher has given you:
# * The teacher across the hall saw a tall kid run out of the classroom
# * The secretary saw a girl run out of the building
# * The janitor saw some with red hair running down the hall
